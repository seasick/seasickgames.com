title: Zynga laid off over 500 employees, some insight @ reddit
---

A former employee of Zynga answers questions on [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fpbv1/i_was_one_of_the_520_people_laid_off_by_zynga/).

Some of the questions

-   What percent of users actually pay real money in Zynga games?
-   What (if anything) do you think they did right as a company?
-   How much longer will Zynga be around for?
-   What are the benefits of working at Zynga?
-   I heard Zynga is expanding into the gambling sector. Surely there's huge money there. Do you know anything about that?
-   And much much more, its like a never ending thread

So if you want to know more about Zynga, I suggest you have a look into it :)
