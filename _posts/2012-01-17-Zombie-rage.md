title: Zombie Rage - current state
---

I made a short video of the current state the project I'm working on.

> Sorry, video got lost in blog migration

As you can see, it is not much, but its something :) The menu is working - even with settings, where you can change the window size. There is also an intro, but I was a little bit lazy to put this into the video also (it is just text - so you haven't missed anything). The zombies are walking in my direction, and as you can see, I used the sprites mentioned in my previous post "I found my zombies").

The next part (which I tried to avoid in the video) is integrating a neat path finding algorithm. The first thing I stumbled upon was the ["A*" algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm "A* Search Algorithm"). At the moment I'm not sure how I can get this into my code without having the frames per second dropping below 25 ... but as always - there is a solution out there :)
