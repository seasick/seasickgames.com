### Reading RFC made easy ...

Reading a RFC has always been a pain in the ass. No pain no more - today I discovered [PrettyRFC](http://pretty-rfc.herokuapp.com/ "Pretty RFC")! This little tool reformats the boring plain text RFC documents into rich text documents featuring a index of contents and linking between different RFCs. Above of it all you won't hurt your eyes reading it.

### Love2d 0.8 released

It's a little bit late to blog about it, but better late than never. A new release of [love2d 0.8](http://www.love2d.org/ "Love2D") (name Rubber Piggy) was released on April the 8th. The biggest change: They added shaders! The new release also features the latest version of [Box2D](http://www.box2d.org/ "Box2D"), a physics engine for games - but this also breaks some stuff, because Box2D had vast API changes. You can read all about this and other changes in the [release notes](https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=8750 "Love2d 0.8 release notes").
