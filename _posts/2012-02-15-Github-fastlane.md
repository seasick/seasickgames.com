Work related I have to get my head a little bit deeper into Git and GitHub. So I've been reading a few articles, and I'm pretty sure I will read more of them :)

On of the things I stumbled upon is this [awesome image](http://www.flickr.com/photos/unruthless/5650265962/sizes/o/), which describes a possible workflow when you want to contribute to an other project on GitHub. You will find most of the things you need to know on this image!

Also a very helpful is the [help of GitHub](http://help.github.com/) itself, which is hosted as [git project](https://github.com/github/help.github.com) itself.
