title: Unity 3D ... My next challenge
---

Again ... no posting for a longer period. Yes, I'am kinda lazy :) Dispite my lazyness I manage from time to time to get my focus on some things. This time it is [Unity 3D](http://www.unity3d.com/ "Unity 3d"). You may be familiar with it - it is "just another" game engine.

But this one is special. Not only there is a free license for it, you can build your games for Windows, Mac, Linux (with version 4) and the web. If you are willing to pay, you can even build for Android, iOS, PS3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii and Flash. Pretty awesome right? But wait there is more! There are no anual fees or royalties per title!

Unity will make all the heavy lifting for you

-   Rendering
-   Lightning
-   Terrain
-   Physics
-   Audio
-   Networking

The editor itself is very user friendly. Not sure yet, but for coders maybe a bit too friendly :) I'm used to use my Keyboard a lot - with Unity I need my mouse more often than usual.

A killer feature is the ability to start the current scene you are working on directly from the editor. You can even tweak some attributes and make changes while playing.

Unity also comes with a asset store, where you can purchase things like models, materials, audio, scripts, particle systems, editor extensions or even complete projects.

I'm looking forward to create somthing I can publish again :)
