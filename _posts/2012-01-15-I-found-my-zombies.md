title: I found my zombies
---

The game on which I'm currently working involves zombies. In my last game, the zombies were only represented by boring circles. So I'm eager to change this - but my graphical skills are limited to a few things I learned decades ago.

Luckily there are many sources on the net, were you can get stuff for your projects. I've found a spritesheet for my zombies on [OpenGameArt.org](http://opengameart.org/). I will use those for my current project - *braaaaains* :)

If you are searching for free stuff like those, you will find many different pages. There are a few good, but most of them are outdated and nearly dead. Have a look at a few sites I've been looking at:

- [OpenGameArt.org](http://opengameart.org/)
- [CgTextures](http://cgtextures.com/)
- [Lost Garden](http://www.lostgarden.com/) (very nice blog, includes some free art)
- [OpenFontLibrary](http://openfontlibrary.org/)
- [Pixel Prospector](http://www.pixelprospector.com/) (a blog all about indie gaming - they have huge lists about everything)
