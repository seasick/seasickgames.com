title: RaspberryPi Keyboard!
---

As a proud owner of a RaspberryPi I definitely need a keyboard for it, if I'm carrying it with me.

So what are the options?

-   A [silicon flexible keyboard](http://www.amazon.com/NEEWER%C2%AE-Portable-Flexible-Silicone-Keyboard/dp/B00092Q210), which I could roll together, and would fit anywhere
-   A very small keyboard
-   A smartphone app, which will be my keyboard (via USB, Bluetooth or WLAN)
-   Or integrate the RaspberryPi into a normal [Cherry keyboard](http://preamp.org/mods/raspcherry-pi) (pictures inside!)

I didn't want a normal sized keyboard, but that ... that is just awesome :)

To sum it up for you:

-   He used a [Cherry G80-3000](http://www.cherry.de/cid/b2b_tastaturen_G80-3000.htm). It's very robust ("*you could put a nail with it into the wall*") and nearly empty.
-   HDMI seems to be not a good idea to extend. So he choose to put the HDMI connector at the rear end of the keyboard.
-   To into the keyboard, the USB and cinch connector had to be detached.
-   With all the other connectors inside, they need to be extended.
-   Holes were first drilled and cut in shape afterwards.
-   The hollow space behind the connectors (USB, LAN, Audio [still missing]) was filled up with Epoxy.
-   The keyboard is connected internally.
-   Thus leaving the keyboards original USB connector as the power source (remember, at least 700mA at 5V).
