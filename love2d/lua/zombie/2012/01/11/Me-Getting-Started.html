</ul><p>Making games was always a dream for me. A desire for which I was to lazy to make it real. First thought - Me making the next generation FPS - or even better - I’m making an MMORPG like World of Warcraft. After some thinking and reading, more thinking and more reading I realized that I have to establish knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>But how do I got started?</p>

<p>Location, loca … erm … Information, Information, Information. I kept googling many nights on different topics, made my way through different indie blogs, got distracted for hours at 9gag  . I read about Game patterns, searched for inspiration on deviantart and googled for free art - and by free I mean like “Creative Common”-free (there’s plenty of good stuff out there). But mostly I was searching for an engine with which I could try out some things. And there are also an ass full of game engines/frameworks out there. Some for money, some for free.</p>

<p>Of course - if I’m making a game it has to be three dimensional! So the first engine with which I played around was “Ogre3D”. That meant I had to refresh my C++ skills. After playing around for a few days I had to admit that neither my coding skills, my ass kicking 3d modeling skills or the understanding of what I’m getting into was at an satisfying level. So I dropped the whole idea of making a 3D game, and stopped thinking about it.</p>

<p>Many months later I found myself again browsing some engines and I decided to give a two dimensional engine a shot. The engine which got my attention was “Löve2d”. Taken from the website - “This is an <em>awesome</em> framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua. It’s free, open-source, and works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux”. I played around with it and with the language - a lot of fun  I even ordered two books for Lua, which I was reading before going to bed ^^</p>

<p>Since I love zombies, I decided to do something in that direction.</p>

<p>I will post the game with my next post - don’t expect too much</p>
